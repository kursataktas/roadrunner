## v2.12.0 (24.11.2022)

# ⚠️ `websocket` and `broadcast` plugins were replaced by the new `centrifuge` plugin.
# ⚠️ All plugins, `sdk` and `api` updated to `v3`. There are no breaking changes, we moved all Go code from the `api` to `sdk`.

## 👀 New:

- ✏ **All plugins**: update to `v3`. This is done not because of some breaking change but because of the internal update.
- ✏ **RPC plugin**: add new API to provide a running RR version and RR configuration in JSON format.
- ✏ **Metrics plugin**: add new API to unregister previously registered collector. (thanks @butschster)
- ✏ **Server plugin**: add new API to get statuses about the service and its child processes. (thanks @butschster)
- ✏ **App logger plugin**: Application logger plugin, [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1227) (thanks @wolfy-j)
  **Docs**: [PHP-lib](https://github.com/roadrunner-php/app-logger)
- ✏ **AMQP plugin**: new configuration options. [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1351), (thanks @andrey-tech)
```yaml
jobs:
  pipelines:
    example:
      driver: amqp
      config:
        # Durable exchange
        #
        # Default: true
        exchange_durable: true

        # Auto-deleted exchange
        #
        # Default: false
        exchange_auto_deleted: false

        # Auto-deleted queue
        #
        # Default: false
        queue_auto_deleted: false
```

- ✏ **Workers pool (SDK)**: New option to control the `reset_timeout`. Note that the `pool.Reset` is protected by mutexes, meaning that if you have some requests already in the pool, you'll have to wait for these requests to be processed. The `reset_timeout` does not count this time.

```yaml
pool:
  allocate_timeout: 10s
  reset_timeout: 10s
  destroy_timeout: 10s
```

- ✏ **Centrifugo plugin**: New `centrifugo` plugin. Which is going to replace existing `broadcast` + `websockets` plugins. [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1134).

```yaml
temporal:
  address: 127.0.0.1:7233
  cache_size: 100000
  activities:
    num_workers: 4

  tls:
    key: client.key
    cert: client.pem
    root_ca: ca.cert
    client_auth_type: require_and_verify_client_cert
    server_name: "tls-sample"

- ✏ **Internal**: PHP Worker now uses an [FSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) to transition between states (`working`, `ready`, `invalid`, etc).
- ✏ **Internal**: `./rr reset` now works in parallel. All workers will be restarted simultaneously instead of a one-by-one sync approach.
- ✏ **Internal**: `./rr reset` and destroy (when stopping RR) now gracefully stop the workers (giving a chance for the finalizers to work). If the worker doesn't respond in 10 seconds, it'll be killed.


## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 **SQS plugin**: Incorrect detection of the `AWS IMDSv2` instances, [BUG](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1250) (thanks @paulermo)
- 🐛 **Temporal plugin**: Segmentation violation when using TLS, [BUG](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1278), (thanks @seregazhuk)

    prefix: "samples"
    type: "summary"
  activities:
    num_workers: 4
```

**Statsd:**
```yaml
temporal:
  address: "127.0.0.1:7233"

## v2.11.0 (18.08.2022)

## ⚠️ NewRelic middleware was removed. Please, use [OTEL middleware instead](https://roadrunner.dev/docs/middleware-otel/2.x/en)
## ⚠️ In `2.12.0` we plan to replace `websockets` and `broadcast` plugins with the `centrifuge` plugin. However, if you still need a RR with these deprecated plugins, you may use `Velox` to build your custom build.

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ **[BETA]: RoadRunner**: Can now be embedded in other go programs. [PR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/pull/1214), (thanks @khepin)
- ✏️ **gRPC Plugin**: Implement Google's `gRPC` [errors API](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). The exception might be passed as a `Status` structure in the `Metadata` (key - `error`) to be parsed and returned to the user w/o worker restart. NOTE: `Status` structure should be marshaled via `proto` marshaller, not `json`. [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1001)
- ✏️ **Logger Plugin**: Get rid of the `context deadline exceeded` error on worker's allocation. We updated the error message with the link to the docs with the most common causes for the `worker allocation failed` error: https://roadrunner.dev/docs/known-issues-allocate-timeout/2.x/en. Feel free to add your cases here :)
- ✏️ **CLI**: New CLI command to pause, resume, destroy and list Jobs. [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1088), (thanks @hustlahusky)

- ✏️ **Velox**: Velox now respects the plugin's `replace` directives. (thanks, @darkweak)
- ✏️ **Cache plugin**: RR now uses a [great cache](https://github.com/darkweak/souin) (RFC 7234) plugin made by @darkweak
- ✏️ **[BETA] Kafka plugin**: New Kafka driver for the Jobs plugin. [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1128), (thanks, @Smolevich)
- ✏️ **Temporal plugin**: Temporal now uses a new reset mechanism to prevent WF worker restarts on activity worker failure
- ✏️ **Temporal plugin**: Temporal plugin now supports a TSL-based authentication with the key and certificate.

Configuration:
```yaml
temporal:
  tls:
    key: path/to/key
    cert: path/to/cert
  # other options
```

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 **Server plugin**: use the `allocate_timeout` from the pool to wait for the `tcp/unix` socket connection from the PHP worker. [BUG](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1226), (thanks @Warxcell)
- 🐛 **Velox**: Fix panic when no `github` option is specified in the configuration.
- 🐛 **SDK**: Use `pool.allocate_timeout` for the sockets/tcp relays instead of silently used of `relay_timeout`.

## 🧹 Chore:

- 🧽 **Logger plugin**: use the parsable timestamp format for the `raw` logger mode. [CH](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1236), (thanks @ilsenem)

## 🔧 Maintenance:

- Temporal `GO-SDK` and `API` updated to the latest versions.

- 🐛 Fix: correct `reset` order for the RR and Temporal workers.

---

## v2.10.3 (02.06.2022)

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ **CLI**: `rr stop` command. `rr stop` will read the `.pid` file to send a graceful stop signal to the main RR process (`SIGTERM`). [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1162) (thanks @Baiquette)

---

## v2.10.2 (26.05.2022)

## 👀 New:
- ✏️ **WORKER**: Starting from this release, RR is able to show full error messages sent to the `STDOUT` during the worker bootstrap.
- ✏️ **HTTP**: Connection might be upgraded from the `http/1.1` to `h2c`: [rfc7540](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-3.4)

- ✏️ **protoc-gen-php-grpc**: Use of fully qualified names in place of imports. [PR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/grpc/pull/30) (thanks @ryanjcohen)

---

## v2.10.1 (19.05.2022)

## 👀 New:
- ✏️ **Jobs (queues)** plugin now can consume any payload from the queue. If RR fails in converting payload into the `Job` structure, it'll create and fill all available fields manually. To turn **on** this feature, use `consume_all: true` in the driver configuration, e.g.:
Supported drivers: `amqp`, `sqs`,`beanstalk`,`nats`.

```yaml
jobs:
  num_pollers: 10
  pipeline_size: 100000
  pool:
    num_workers: 10

  pipelines:
    test-raw:
      driver: sqs
      config:
        consume_all: true # <------- NEW OPTION

  consume: [ "test-raw" ]
```

- ✏️ **SQS** Jobs driver now can skip queue declaration in favor of getting queue URL instead. To use this feature, use `skip_queue_declaration: true` sqs driver option. [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/980), (thanks @sergey-telpuk)

```yaml
jobs:
  num_pollers: 10
  pipeline_size: 100000
  pool:
    num_workers: 10

  pipelines:
    test-2:
      driver: sqs
      config:
        skip_queue_declaration: true # <----- NEW OPTION

  consume: [ "test-2" ]
```

- ✏️ OpenTelemetry middleware now supports `Jaeger` exporter and propagator.

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:43239
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: [gzip, otel]
  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s

otel:
  exporter: jaeger # <----- NEW OPTION
```

- ✏️ **HTTP Plugin** now supports [`mTLS` authentication](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/). Possible values for the `client_auth_type` are the same as for the `gRPC` (`no_client_cert`, `request_client_cert`,`require_any_client_cert`,`verify_client_cert_if_given`,`require_and_verify_client_cert`) [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1111), (thanks @fwolfsjaeger)

```yaml
version: '2.7'

server:
  command: "php ../../php_test_files/http/client.php echo pipes"
  relay: "pipes"
  relay_timeout: "20s"

http:
  address: :8085
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: [ ]
  pool:
    num_workers: 1
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
  ssl:
    address: :8895
    key: "key"
    cert: "cert"
    root_ca: "rootCA.pem" # <---- REQUIRED to use mTLS
    client_auth_type: require_and_verify_client_cert # <---- NEW OPTION
logs:
  mode: development
  level: error
```

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 Fix: **HTTP plugin**: non-documented behavior on non-standard (but valid) http codes. [BUG](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1136), (thanks, @Meroje)
- 🐛 Fix: **SQS driver**: `rr_auto_ack` attribute won't fail the existing messages.

## v2.10.0 (16.05.2022)

## 👀 New:
- ✏️ Documentation update: [link](https://roadrunner.dev).
- ✏️ **RoadRunner-Temporal plugin now supports local activities**. Here is the brief overview: [link](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/temporal-explained/activities/#local-activity).
- ✏️ Add Debian `amd64` releases. [FEATURE](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/940)
- ✏️ Add signed releases. Starting from the `v2.10.0`, every released binary can be checked with a provided `*.asc` key. For example:
```bash
$ gpg --verify rr.asc
```

The openPGP key can be verified here: [keyserver](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x9480A51C85D357D0&fingerprint=on&op=index)

- ✏️ All proto api for the `Go` programming language located here: [link](https://buf.build/roadrunner-server/api). To use it, just import the latest stable version `go.buf.build/protocolbuffers/go/roadrunner-server/api latest`.
- ✏️ `Service` plugin now supports auto-reload. It can be added to the `reload` plugin targets and on change, it'll reload all underlying processes.
- ✏️ `AutoAck` jobs option. For the messages (jobs), which are acceptable to lose. Or which execution can lead to a worker's stop (for example - OOM).
- ✏️ **[BETA] OpenTelemetry support**. Starting from now, the `new_relic` middleware is deprecated, it'll receive only dependency updates and will be removed from the RR bundle in the `v2.12.0`. (thanks @brettmc)
OpenTelemetry plugin supports the following exporters:
  1. OTLP (open telemetry protocol): `datadog`, `new relic`.
  2. zipkin
  3. stdout
  All these exporters can send their data via `http` or `grpc` clients.

## v2.10.0-alpha.1 (07.04.2022)

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ **[ALPHA]** HTTP response streaming. Available only in the alfa builds.

Worker sample:
```php
<?php

use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;
use Nyholm\Psr7\Response;
use Nyholm\Psr7\Stream;
use Spiral\RoadRunner;

ini_set('display_errors', 'stderr');
require __DIR__ . "/vendor/autoload.php";

$worker = RoadRunner\Worker::create();
$psr7 = new RoadRunner\Http\PSR7Worker(
    $worker,
    new Psr17Factory(),
    new Psr17Factory(),
    new Psr17Factory()
);

$psr7->chunk_size = 10 * 10 * 1024;
$filename = 'file.tmp'; // big file or response

while ($req = $psr7->waitRequest()) {
    try {
        $fp = \fopen($filename, 'rb');
        \flock($fp, LOCK_SH);
        $resp = (new Response())->withBody(Stream::create($fp));
        $psr7->respond($resp);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        $psr7->getWorker()->error((string)$e);
    }

```

Known issues:
1. RR will not notify a worker if HTTP connection was interrupted. RR will read all response from the worker and drop it. That will be fixed in the stable streaming release.
2. Sometimes RR may miss the immediate error from the worker and send a 0 payload with 200 status. This is related only to the http response.


- ✏️ **[BETA]** Local activities support [link](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/concepts/what-is-a-local-activity).

- ✏️ **API**: `Queuer` interface for the workers pool to show the number of requests waiting for the worker. Implemented in **SDK**.

---

## v2.8.0 (17.02.2022)

### ⚠️  For the RR `v2.8.0` your `.rr.yaml` configuration version should be [`2.7`](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/blob/master/.rr.yaml), so please update your config and add `version: '2.7'` at the top.

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ Timeout for the SQS create/get queue operations (30seconds) [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/903) (reporter @sergey-telpuk)
- ✏️ New workers pool option -> `command`:
```yaml
http:
    address: 127.0.0.1:8080
    max_request_size: 256
    middleware: ["headers", "gzip"]
    trusted_subnets: []

    # Workers pool settings.
    pool:
        command: "php app.php" <---- NEW
```
This option is used to override the `server`'s command with the new one. The new command will inherit all server options. It can be used in any plugin (`jobs`, `grpc`, `tcp`, `http`, etc) using workers pool (`http` used here as a sample). No need to update your config. By default server command will be used as in the previous RR versions. Note, you can't leave the `server` command option empty. If you wanted to override the command in every plugin you use, put a placeholder in the `server.command`.
- ✏️  Add `Rr_newrelic_ignore` header support. Now you can send the `Rr_newrelic_ignore:true` header and RR will ignore such transactions. No data will be sent to the `newrelic` server. [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/900) (reporter @arku31)
- ✏️ Add support for the SQS FIFO queues [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/906) (reporter @paulermo)
- ✏️ Add support for the gRPC Healthcheck protocol v1 in the `grpc` plugin.  [Doc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md), [FR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/928) (reporter @porozhnyy)

## v2.7.2 (17.01.2022)

## 👀 New:
- Moved to the new organization.

---

## v2.7.0 (14.01.2022)

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ RR `workers pool`, `worker`, `worker_watcher` now has their own log levels. `stderr/stdout` logged as before at the `info` log level. All other messages moved to the `debug` log level except a few events from the `worker_watcher` when RR can't allocate the new worker which are moved to the `warn`.
- ✏️ Use the common logger for the whole roadrunner-sdk and roadrunner-plugins.
- ✏️ `.rr.yaml` now support versions. You may safely use your old configurations w/o specifying versions. Configuration w/o version will be treated as `2.6`. It is safe to use configuration w/o version or with version `2.6` with RR `2.7` because RR is able to automatically transform the old configuration.
  But if you use configuration version `2.7` you must update the `jobs` pipelines config.
  **At this point we can guarantee, that no breaking changes will be introduced in the configuration w/o auto-convert from the older configuration version**
  For example, if we introduce a configuration update let's say in version `2.10`, we will support automatic conversion from at least 2 previous versions w/o involving the user into the process. In the example case, versions `2.9` and `2.8` will be automatically converted. From our release cycle, you will have at least 3 months to update the configuration from version `2.8` and 2 months from `2.9`.Version located at the top of the `.rr.yaml`:

**Before:**
```yaml

      delete_stream_on_stop: false
      delete_after_ack: false
```

**After**:
Now, pipelines have only `driver` key with the configuration under the `config` key. We did that to uniform configuration across all drivers (like in the `KV`).
```yaml
  pipelines:
    test-local:
      driver: memory

      config: # <------------------ NEW

        prefetch: 10000

    test-local-2:
      driver: amqp

      config: # <------------------ NEW
        priority: 11
        prefetch: 100

        rate_limit: 100
        delete_stream_on_stop: false
        delete_after_ack: false
```

- ✏️ **[ALPHA]** New cache http middleware. It is still in alpha, but we started implementing the [rfc-7234](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) to support `Cache-Control` and caching in general. In the first alpha you may test the `max-age`, `Age` and `Authorization` support via the in-memory driver.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
http:
# .....
    middleware: ["cache"]
    cache:
        driver: memory
        cache_methods: ["GET", "HEAD", "POST"] # only GET in alpha
        config: {} # empty configuration for the memory
```

- ✏️ Logger unification. Starting this version we bound our logs to the `uber/zap` log library as one of the most popular and extensible.
- ✏️ API stabilization. All `v2` api interfaces moved to the `https://github.com/roadrunner-server/api` repository. Except logger (structure), all plugins depends only on the interfaces and don't import each other.
- ✏️ `GRPC` plugin now is able to work with gzipped payloads. [FR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/191) (reporter @hetao29)
- ✏️ `SQS` plugin now detects EC2 env and uses AWS credentials instead of static provider. [FR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/142) (reporter @paulermo)
- ✏️ `Jobs` plugin now acknowledges responses with incorrectly formed responses to prevent the infinity loop (with the error message in the logs). [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/190) (reporter @sergey-telpuk)
- ✏️ `protoc` updated to the version `v3.19.2`.

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 Fix: RR may have missed the message from the `stderr` when the PHP script failed to start immediately after RR starts.
- 🐛 Fix: 200 HTTP status code instead of 400 on readiness/health bad requests. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/180)

- 🐛 Fix: NPE in the `http.Reset`. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/155)

---

## v2.6.3 (3.12.2021)

## 👀 New:
- ✏️ `informer.List` RPC call return all available plugins with workers instead of all available plugins. This behavior was changed because `Informer` has the dependency of every RR plugin, which led to the cycles. This is not an external API and used only internally.
- ✏️ Beanstalk queue returned to the **[ALPHA]** stage. It's very unstable when destroying pipelines and can lead to infinite read loops when something wrong with the connection. Use with care.
- ✏️ Go version updated to `v1.17.4`.

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 Fix: add missing plugins to the container: `fileserver`, `http_metrics`.

## v2.6.0 (30.11.2021)

## 👀 New:
- ✏️ New internal message bus. Available globally. Supports wildcard subscriptions (for example: `http.*` will subscribe you to the all events coming from the `http` plugin). The subscriptions can be made from any RR plugin to any RR plugin.
- ✏️ Now, RR will show in the returned error the bad header content in case of CRC mismatch error. More info in the [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/pull/863).
- ✏️ **[BETA]** Support for the New Relic observability platform. Sample of the client library might be
  found [here](https://github.com/arku31/roadrunner-newrelic). (Thanks @arku31)
  New Relic middleware is a part of the HTTP plugin, thus configuration should be inside it:

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:15389
  middleware: [ "new_relic" ] <------- NEW
  new_relic: <---------- NEW
    app_name: "app"
    license_key: "key"
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

License key and application name could be set via environment variables: (leave `app_name` and `license_key` empty)

- license_key: `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`.
- app_name: `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`.

To set the New Relic attributes, the PHP worker should send headers values withing the `rr_newrelic` header key.
Attributes should be separated by the `:`, for example `foo:bar`, where `foo` is a key and `bar` is a value. New Relic
attributes sent from the worker will not appear in the HTTP response, they will be sent directly to the New Relic.

To see the sample of the PHP library, see the @arku31 implementation: https://github.com/arku31/roadrunner-newrelic

The special key which PHP may set to overwrite the transaction name is: `transaction_name`. For
example: `transaction_name:foo` means: set transaction name as `foo`. By default, `RequestURI` is used as the
transaction name.

```php
        $resp = new \Nyholm\Psr7\Response();
        $rrNewRelic = [
            'shopId:1', //custom data
            'auth:password', //custom data
            'transaction_name:test_transaction' //name - special key to override the name. By default it will use requestUri.
        ];

        $resp = $resp->withHeader('rr_newrelic', $rrNewRelic);
```

- ✏️ **[BETA]** New plugin: `TCP`. The TCP plugin is used to handle raw TCP payload with a bi-directional [protocol](tcp/docs/tcp.md) between the RR server and PHP worker.

PHP client library: https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-tcp

Configuration:
```yaml
rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php ../../psr-worker-tcp-cont.php"

tcp:
  servers:
    server1:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:7778
      delimiter: "\r\n"
    server2:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:8811
      read_buf_size: 10
    server3:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:8812
      delimiter: "\r\n"
      read_buf_size: 1

  pool:
    num_workers: 5
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

---

- ✏️ New HTTP middleware: `http_metrics`.
```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:15389
  middleware: [ "http_metrics" ] <------- NEW
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```
All old and new http metrics will be available after the middleware is activated. Be careful, this middleware may slow down your requests. New metrics:

    - `rr_http_requests_queue_sum` - number of queued requests.
    - `rr_http_no_free_workers_total` - number of the occurrences of the `NoFreeWorkers` errors.


-----

- ✏️ New file server to serve static files. It works on a different address, so it doesn't affect the HTTP performance. It uses advanced configuration specific for the static file servers. It can handle any number of directories with its own HTTP prefixes.
  Config:

```yaml
fileserver:
  # File server address
  #
  # Error on empty
  address: 127.0.0.1:10101
  # Etag calculation. Request body CRC32.
  #
  # Default: false
  calculate_etag: true

  # Weak etag calculation
  #
  # Default: false
  weak: false

  # Enable body streaming for the files more than 4KB
  #
  # Default: false
  stream_request_body: true

  serve:
    # HTTP prefix
    #
    # Error on empty
  - prefix: "/foo"

    # Directory to serve
    #
    # Default: "."
    root: "../../../tests"

    # When set to true, the server tries minimizing CPU usage by caching compressed files
    #
    # Default: false
    compress: false

    # Expiration duration for inactive file handlers. Units: seconds.
    #
    # Default: 10, use a negative value to disable it.
    cache_duration: 10

    # The value for the Cache-Control HTTP-header. Units: seconds
    #
    # Default: 10 seconds
    max_age: 10

    # Enable range requests
    # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests
    #
    # Default: false
    bytes_range: true

  - prefix: "/foo/bar"
    root: "../../../tests"
    compress: false
    cache_duration: 10s
    max_age: 10
    bytes_range: true
```

- ✏️ `on_init` option for the `server` plugin. `on_init` code executed before the regular command and can be used to warm up the application for example. Failed `on_init` command doesn't affect the main command, so, the RR will continue to run. Thanks (@OO00O0O)

Config:
```yaml
# Application server settings (docs: https://roadrunner.dev/docs/php-worker)
server:
  on_init: <----------- NEW
    # Command to execute before the main server's command
    #
    # This option is required if using on_init
    command: "any php or script here"

    # Script execute timeout
    #
    # Default: 60s [60m, 60h], if used w/o units its means - NANOSECONDS.
    exec_timeout: 20s

    # Environment variables for the worker processes.
    #
    # Default: <empty map>
    env:
      - SOME_KEY: "SOME_VALUE"
      - SOME_KEY2: "SOME_VALUE2"

  # ..REGULAR SERVER OPTIONS...
```

---

- ✏️ **[BETA]** GRPC can handle multiply proto files.
  Config:
```yaml
# GRPC service configuration
grpc:
    # Proto files to use
    #
    # This option is required. At least one proto file must be specified.
    proto:
        - "first.proto"
        - "second.proto"

## ... OTHER REGULAR GRPC OPTIONS ...
```

---

- ✏️ New `allow` configuration option for the `http.uploads` and multipart requests. The new option allows you to filter upload extensions knowing only allowed. Now, there is no need to have a looong list with all possible extensions to forbid. [FR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/123) (Thanks @rjd22)
  `http.uploads.forbid` has a higher priority, so, if you have duplicates in the `http.uploads.allow` and `http.uploads.forbid` the duplicated extension will be forbidden.
  Config:

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:18903
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: ["pluginMiddleware", "pluginMiddleware2"]
  uploads:
    forbid: [".php", ".exe", ".bat"]
    allow: [".html", ".aaa" ] <------------- NEW
  trusted_subnets:
    [
      "10.0.0.0/8",
      "127.0.0.0/8",
      "172.16.0.0/12",
      "192.168.0.0/16",
      "::1/128",
      "fc00::/7",
      "fe80::/10",
    ]
  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ✏️ Beanstalk queue reject stop RPC calls if there are jobs in the priority queue associated with the requested
  pipeline.

- ✏️ Startup message when the RR has started.

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 Fix: GRPC server will show message when started.
- 🐛 Fix: Static plugin headers were added to all requests. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/115)

## v2.5.0 (20.10.2021)

# 💔 Breaking change:

- 🔨 Some drivers now use a new `config` key to handle local configuration. Involved plugins and drivers:
- `plugins`: `broadcast`, `kv`
- `drivers`: `memory`, `redis`, `memcached`, `boltdb`.

### Old style:

```yaml
broadcast:
    default:
        driver: memory
        interval: 1
```

### New style:

```yaml
broadcast:
  default:
    driver: memory
     config: {} <--------------- NEW
```

```yaml
kv:
  memory-rr:
    driver: memory
    config: <--------------- NEW
      interval: 1

kv:
  memcached-rr:
    driver: memcached
    config: <--------------- NEW
       addr:
         - "127.0.0.1:11211"

broadcast:
  default:
    driver: redis
    config: <------------------ NEW
      addrs:
        - "127.0.0.1:6379"
```

## 👀 New:

- ✏️ **[BETA]** GRPC plugin update to v2.
- ✏️ [Roadrunner-plugins](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins) repository. This is the new home for the roadrunner plugins with documentation, configuration samples, and common problems.
- ✏️ **[BETA]** Let's Encrypt support. RR now can obtain an SSL certificate/PK for your domain automatically. Here is the new configuration:
```yaml
    ssl:
      # Host and port to listen on (eg.: `127.0.0.1:443`).
      #
      # Default: ":443"
      address: "127.0.0.1:443"

      # Use ACME certificates provider (Let's encrypt)
      acme:
        # Directory to use as a certificate/pk, account info storage
        #
        # Optional. Default: rr_cache
        certs_dir: rr_le_certs

        # User email
        #
        # Used to create LE account. Mandatory. Error on empty.
        email: you-email-here@email

        # Alternate port for the http challenge. Challenge traffic should be redirected to this port if overridden.
        #
        # Optional. Default: 80
        alt_http_port: 80,


        # Alternate port for the tls-alpn-01 challenge. Challenge traffic should be redirected to this port if overridden.
        #
        # Optional. Default: 443.
        alt_tlsalpn_port: 443,

        # Challenge types
        #
        # Optional. Default: http-01. Possible values: http-01, tlsalpn-01
        challenge_type: http-01

        # Use production or staging endpoints. NOTE, try to use the staging endpoint (`use_production_endpoint`: `false`) to make sure, that everything works correctly.
        #
        # Optional, but for production should be set to true. Default: false
        use_production_endpoint: true

        # List of your domains to obtain certificates
        #
        # Mandatory. Error on empty.
        domains: [
            "your-cool-domain.here",
            "your-second-domain.here"
        ]
```

- ✏️ Add a new option to the `logs` plugin to configure the line ending. By default, used `\n`.

**New option**:
```yaml
# Logs plugin settings
logs:
    (....)
    # Line ending
    #
    # Default: "\n".
    line_ending: "\n"
```

- ✏️ HTTP [Access log support](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/34) at the `Info` log level.
```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:55555
  max_request_size: 1024
  access_logs: true <-------- Access Logs ON/OFF
  middleware: []

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```
- ✏️ HTTP middleware to handle `X-Sendfile` [header](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/9).
  Middleware reads the file in 10MB chunks. So, for example for the 5Gb file, only 10MB of RSS will be used. If the file size is smaller than 10MB, the middleware fits the buffer to the file size.
```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:44444
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: ["sendfile"] <----- NEW MIDDLEWARE

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ✏️ Service plugin now supports env variables passing to the script/executable/binary/any like in the `server` plugin:
```yaml
service:
  some_service_1:
    command: "php test_files/loop_env.php"
    process_num: 1
    exec_timeout: 5s # s,m,h (seconds, minutes, hours)
    remain_after_exit: true
    env:  <----------------- NEW
      foo: "BAR"
    restart_sec: 1
```

- ✏️ Server plugin can accept scripts (sh, bash, etc) in it's `command` configuration key:
```yaml
server:
    command: "./script.sh OR sh script.sh" <--- UPDATED
    relay: "pipes"
    relay_timeout: "20s"
```
The script should start a worker as the last command. For the `pipes`, scripts should not contain programs, which can close `stdin`, `stdout` or `stderr`.

- ✏️ Nats jobs driver support - [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/pull/68).
```yaml
nats:
  addr: "demo.nats.io"

jobs:
  num_pollers: 10
  pipeline_size: 100000
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s

  pipelines:
    test-1:
      driver: nats
      prefetch: 100
      subject: "default"
      stream: "foo"
      deliver_new: "true"
      rate_limit: 100
      delete_stream_on_stop: false
      delete_after_ack: false
      priority: 2

  consume: [ "test-1" ]
```
- Driver uses NATS JetStream API and is not compatible with non-js API.


- ✏️ Response API for the NATS, RabbitMQ, SQS and Beanstalk drivers. This means, that you'll be able to respond to a specified in the response queue.
  Limitations:
    - To send a response to the queue maintained by the RR, you should send it as a `Job` type. There are no limitations for the responses into the other queues (tubes, subjects).
    - Driver uses the same endpoint (address) to send the response as specified in the configuration.

## 🩹 Fixes:

- 🐛 Fix: local and global configuration parsing.
- 🐛 Fix: `boltdb-jobs` connection left open after RPC close command.
- 🐛 Fix: close `beanstalk` connection and release associated resources after pipeline stopped.
- 🐛 Fix: grpc plugin fails to handle requests after calling `reset`.
- 🐛 Fix: superfluous response.WriteHeader call when connection is broken.

Drivers included in the initial release: `RabbitMQ (0-9-1)`, `SQS v2`, `beanstalk`, `memory` and local queue powered by the `boltdb`. [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/pull/726)
-   ✏️ Support for the IPv6 (`tcp|http(s)|empty [::]:port`, `tcp|http(s)|empty [::1]:port`, `tcp|http(s)|empty :// [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:port`) for RPC, HTTP and other plugins. [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2732#section-2)
-   ✏️ Support for the Docker images via GitHub packages.
-   ✏️ Go 1.17 support for the all spiral packages.

## 🩹 Fixes:

-   🐛 Fix: fixed bug with goroutines waiting on the internal worker's container channel, [issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/750).
-   🐛 Fix: RR become unresponsive when new workers failed to re-allocate, [issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/772).

## v2.3.0 (08.06.2021)

## 👀 New:

-   ✏️ Brand new `broadcast` plugin now has the name - `websockets` with broadcast capabilities. It can handle hundreds of
    thousands websocket connections very efficiently (~300k messages per second with 1k connected clients, in-memory bus
    on 2CPU cores and 1GB of RAM) [Issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/513)
-   ✏️ Protobuf binary messages for the `websockets` and `kv` RPC calls under the
    hood. [Issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/711)
-   ✏️ Json-schemas for the config file v1.0 (it also registered
    in [schemastore.org](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pull/1614))
-   ✏️ `latest` docker image tag supported now (but we strongly recommend using a versioned tag (like `0.2.3`) instead)
-   ✏️ Add new option to the `http` config section: `internal_error_code` to override default (500) internal error
    code. [Issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/659)
-   ✏️ Expose HTTP plugin metrics (workers memory, requests count, requests duration)
    . [Issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/489)
-   ✏️ Scan `server.command` and find errors related to the wrong path to a `PHP` file, or `.ph`, `.sh`
    scripts. [Issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/658)
-   ✏️ Support file logger with log rotation [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_rotation)
    , [Issue](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/545)

## 🩹 Fixes:

-   🐛 Fix: Bug with `informer.Workers` worked incorrectly: [Bug](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/686)

    error: [Bug](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/691)
-   🐛 Fix: Wrong applied middlewares for the `fcgi` server leads to the
    NPE: [Bug](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/701)

## 📦 Packages:

-   📦 Update goridge to `v3.1.0`

---

## v2.2.1 (13.05.2021)

## 🩹 Fixes:

-   🐛 Fix: revert static plugin. It stays as a separate plugin on the main route (`/`) and supports all the previously
    announced features.
-   🐛 Fix: remove `build` and other old targets from the Makefile.

---

## v2.2.0 (11.05.2021)

## 👀 New:

-   ✏️ Reworked `static` plugin. Now, it does not affect the performance of the main route and persist on the separate
    file server (within the `http` plugin). Looong awaited feature: `Etag` (+ weak Etags) as well with the `If-Mach`
    , `If-None-Match`, `If-Range`, `Last-Modified`
    and `If-Modified-Since` tags supported. Static plugin has a bunch of new options such as: `allow`, `calculate_etag`
    , `weak` and `pattern`.

    ### Option `always` was deleted from the plugin.

-   ✏️ Update `informer.List` implementation. Now it returns a list with the all available plugins in the runtime.

## 🩹 Fixes:

-   🐛 Fix: issue with wrong ordered middlewares (reverse). Now the order is correct.
-   🐛 Fix: issue when RR fails if a user sets `debug` mode with the `exec_ttl` supervisor option.
-   🐛 Fix: uniform log levels. Use everywhere the same levels (warn, error, debug, info, panic).

---

## v2.1.1 (29.04.2021)
